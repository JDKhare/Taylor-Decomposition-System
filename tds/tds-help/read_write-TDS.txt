Rading and writing files in TDS
-------------------------------

tds -f script_file.scr 
	- will process the script file in the background.

Tds 01> read -h
usage: read -[hbc] input.[gc|mx|scr|cdfg]
   [b] sets the netlist to combinational, only for gc files [default=false]
   [c] load the value of constants, only for cdfg files [default=false]

Meaning of option -c:
	By default all constants (Co..) are treated as variables
	With -c option, the actual integer values are used as labels on edges.

   gc = old GAUT format
   cdfg = GAUT2 format
   mx   = matrix format (matrix of integer coefficients)
   scr  = script format

Tds> read  script_file.scr 
	- to process the script.

Tds> read  matrix.mx  
	- reads the file in matrix coefficent format and produces a network.
Example:
	Taylor Decomposition System
	Compiled at: 15:07(GMT), 05-20-2008
	Tds 01> read matrix1.mx 
	Tds 02> collapse
	Tds 03> show
	Tds 04> print -e
	    m0_4 = X0+X1*3+X2*(-2)
	    m1_4 = X0*3+X1*5+X2*3
	    m2_4 = (X0*(-2)+X1+X2*(-3))*(-1)
	Tds 05> 

Tds> read  gaut_file.cdfg will read the cdfg file produced by Gaut2
	- after that, use command <showntk> to show the network;
	  make sure to issue <colapse> to create a TED from the network
	  before issuing all the TED-related commands.

Tds> write file.cdfg (prepared by Qian)
	- to create a cdfg file (for Gaut2) from the network data base

Tds> write -t file.cdfg (prepared by Daniel)
	- to create a cdfg file from the TED data base.
