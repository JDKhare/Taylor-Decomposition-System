Hi professor,

REGARDING fn:
---------------------
We can look on your .bashrc on Tuesday, I should be available some time=20
after 1pm. Briefly, all aliases loaded by the .bashrc login script are=20
located in files provided within .bashrc in the form of:

if [ -f $HOME/.file ]; then
   . $HOME/.file
fi

typical file names are: { .aliases, .bashrc_aliases, .functions,=20
.bashrc_functions, /etc/bash_completion } In any case, the file must be=20
listed in the login script run by the shell. Sometimes the loaded file,=20
points to other locations as well, so it is important to check any other=20
file loading.


Regarding ABC:
---------------------
As you mention you are missing the readline libraries. You can type in=20
your ubuntu box:

$ apt-cache search libreadline

and it should print

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
libreadline6 xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
libreadline6-dev xxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

If you don't have those lines, then your compilation is rightfully=20
failing. To fix that,
please type:

$ sudo apt-get install libreadline6 libreadline6-dev

This should resolve the compilation issue for ABC (and TDS should have=20
the same problem in this machine)

- EOF -

best regards,
Daniel
