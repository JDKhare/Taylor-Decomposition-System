Taylor Decompsition System: A Behavioral Transformation System based on Canonical Dataflow Representation

TDS is an experimental software tool for behavioral transformations of designs 
specified on algorithmic and behavioral levels. It transforms the initial design specifications into a data 
flow graph (DFG) optimized for a particular objective (latency, resource utilization, etc.) prior to high
level synthesis. The behavioral transformations are based on graph-based canonical representation, 
Taylor Expansion Diagram (TED), and are followed by structural transformations of the resulting DFG 
network. The system is intended for data-flow and computation-intensive designs used in digital signal 
processing applications.
